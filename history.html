    <h1>Karl Rapp</h1>
    <h2>German Engineer (1882-1962)</h2> 
    <p>Karl Rapp was a German engineer and one of the key figures in the early history of BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke). He founded Rapp Motorenwerke GmbH in 1913, which initially focused on manufacturing aircraft engines. Rapp’s company played a crucial role in the early aviation industry, particularly during World War I.

      In 1917, due to financial difficulties and the increasing demand for aircraft engines, Rapp Motorenwerke was reorganized into BMW, with Franz Josef Popp and Max Friz joining the company. Rapp's departure from the company marked the transition, and BMW began to establish itself as a leading manufacturer of aircraft engines, motorcycles, and later, automobiles.
      
      Karl Rapp's contribution laid the foundation for what would become one of the world's most renowned automobile manufacturers, even though he is less celebrated compared to other figures like Popp and Friz.</p>

    <h1>Franz Josef Popp</h1>
    <h2>Austrian Businessman (1886-1954)</h2>
    <p>Franz Josef Popp was an Austrian engineer and industrialist who played a pivotal role in the founding and development of BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke). Born on January 14, 1886, in Vienna, Austria, Popp was initially involved in the electrical engineering industry before transitioning to aviation during World War I.

      Popp became the General Director of BMW in 1917 when the company was restructured from Rapp Motorenwerke. Under his leadership, BMW shifted its focus from producing aircraft engines to manufacturing motorcycles and eventually automobiles. Popp was instrumental in shaping BMW’s early identity and expanding its product lines, guiding the company through its formative years.
      
      He remained with BMW until 1942, during which time the company grew into a significant player in the automotive industry. Franz Josef Popp passed away on July 29, 1954.</p>

    <h1>Camillo Castiglioni</h1>
    <h2>Austrian financier and banker (1879-1957)</h2>
    <p>Camillo Castiglioni was an influential Austrian-Italian financier and industrialist who played a significant role in the early history of BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke). Born on October 22, 1879, in Trieste, Austria-Hungary (now Italy), Castiglioni was known as one of the wealthiest men in Europe during the early 20th century.

      Castiglioni had a diverse career, starting in law and banking before moving into industrial ventures. He became involved with BMW through his financial investments and strategic vision. In 1918, he bought the rights to the BMW name and logo from Karl Rapp's company, Rapp Motorenwerke GmbH, and played a crucial role in the company's transformation and growth.
      
      His financial backing and business acumen were vital in BMW’s expansion from an aircraft engine manufacturer into the broader fields of motorcycle and automobile production. However, his later financial difficulties led him to sell his shares in BMW.
      
      Camillo Castiglioni passed away on December 18, 1957.</p>

    <h1>BMW DIXI</h1>
  </div>

<div id="para">
  <p>The BMW Dixi, introduced in 1928, holds the distinction of being BMW's first car, marking the company's transition from an aircraft engine and motorcycle manufacturer to an automobile producer. The Dixi was essentially a licensed version of the British Austin 7, a popular and affordable car of the era. BMW's version, the 3/15 PS, was produced in Eisenach, Germany, and featured a 747 cc inline-four engine capable of producing 15 horsepower, which was quite modest by today's standards but sufficient for the time. The Dixi was available in several body styles, including a two-door sedan and a convertible, and it played a crucial role in establishing BMW's reputation in the automotive industry. This small, reliable, and economical vehicle laid the foundation for BMW's future success, setting the stage for the company's evolution into a leading luxury car manufacturer.</p>
